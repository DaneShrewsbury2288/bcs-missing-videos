# BCS MISSING VIDEOS

## What?

A web application that connects to BCS API to get a list of Cohorts and their sessions to quickly find missing videos on each of them. 

## But why?

What started as a way to not individually click each of the 72 sessions ended up as an application that can help other not do the same.
